                                    <p>"Esquio" was based on an urban place in Baguio City. We just decided to change and add a little work of ourselves. We chose to work with this idea because we thought that we also need to appreciate this kind of place. The idea of imagining these places was extraordinary. From the mountains, the buildings, and through the houses that were stuck together. Visible clouds and birds fly freely. We love to show people the beauty of urban places.</p>

                                    <p>The "Palasangtingan" simply means aesthetic. The Student with prosthetic legs, where it is shown that disability is not an obstacle so that we can make ourselves aware of new abilities that our country can be proud of. Second is the magnifying glass that has a reflected image of the buildings, even though the focus of its glass is the scenery of Greenland. This is simply the definition of progress in a place that we cannot deny that there are many changes happening nowadays. Third is the butterfly that lands on the eye, which symbolizes the hope of manifesting the ability that we can see in ourselves even though there are many changes in the environment and in future generations. Last but not the least is the puzzle of buildings, which presents the construction of development. It reminds everyone that progress does not just happen in an easy process, it takes pains to plan and build.</p>
